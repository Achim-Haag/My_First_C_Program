    14.11.24/AH
    My first C program, derived from c't 25/2024 (8.11.24), page 66 (https://github.com/607011/wordle-c)
    I will type this page's contents step by step, amended by my own modifications
    Insert:
        our brain EPROM's programming durability depends on how we program it:
        listen -> read -> keyboard input -> handwriting

    22.11.24/AH
    After typing in some more of the original source code, I found hints relating curly braces a.s.o :
    https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/standards.html
    So I decided to vary my preferred method (from other programming languages)
    and set the braces in one line with the corresponding statement for functions, struct and enum.
    Another point is writing control statements without curly braces.
    I tend to share the opinion: always use braces as indention isn't recognized by the compiler
    (e.g. adding statements without braces - although indented - lead to misbehaviour and misunderstanding)

    28.11.24/AH
    Completed source, tested ANSI coloring in MVSC / Windows environment
    I will add compiler option /FA to .vscode\tasks.json - it gives a listing for an old fart like me.
    /FA knows optional arguments: c = machine code, s = source code, u = Listing in UTF-8 instead of ANSI

    30.11.24/AH
    Someone ("Hornschorsch") reworked the whole story, now I have to change my copy
    Although I understand the modifications: number of words in word list not dependend on constant
    Added "#" for easy exit

    04.12.24/AH
    Integrated getopt.c from https://github.com/alex85k/wingetopt/tree/master
    as I don't like debugging relying on recompile, so I added processing of two commandline parameters:
    - Parm -h = help
    - Parm -v <verbosity> = level of verbosity (0 = Default = no verbosity)
    The next step will be the processing of the int verbolvl - maybe combined with the precompiler variable definition "DEBUG"

    07.12.24/AH
    More insight after reading german websites
    - https://www.c-howto.de/tutorial/ (language overview)
    - http://c-buch.sommergut.de/index.shtml (deep dive)
    Changed debugging from precompiler to commandline parameter
    - Parm -f = Initialize random generator (rseed) with constant NULL delivers always the same word sequence (for debugging purposes)
    - Parm -c = Cheat - show the word to guess (just for debugging :-P)

    25.04.25/AH
    Added option -p to print wordlist and exit - to test CMake compile/link if submodule words.c was changed) 

    30.04.25/AH
    Correction of help message

    27.05.25/AH
    Found solution for printing numeric precompiler variables to avoid "#pragma message" throws this error:
      warning C4081: expected ')'; found 'constant' from the compiler.

  Global section

  We define global variables before the "main" function, so they're available to all functions in this module
  and possibly in other (linked) modules too, but let me explain:
  The attribute static has two meanings:
  - keep variable in memory over the lifetime of the main program (but always done for global variables)
  - for global variables: don't expose them to the linker (and therefore don't expose them to external modules, e.g.words.c)

  So I have to define the variable verbolvl (debug level from commandline) in this global section as I use it in the 
  subfunctions too - but as I don't want it be used in other modules (words.c, getopts.c), I define it as "static"

  BTW: all global variables are initialized to zero - but as a good programmer, I set them explicitly ;-)
*/

// this defines status as an enumeration template
// it consists of a set of elements that are assigned to numbers

// it doesn't need any storage at runtime as it's only a logical definition
